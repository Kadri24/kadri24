            <p class="mainText">
                Hello, my name is Kadri and I'm an 18-year-old teenager.
                I was born in Italy, and I currently live in the northeast part of the country.
                I dedicate my life to coding and computers, both hardware and software-wise.
                Since I was a kid, I couldn't stop learning more and more, and I think that helped me build my career as
                time passed.
                The more I got old the more I wanted to learn.
            </p>

            <summary class="subTitle">Where it started</summary>
            <p class="mainText">When I was a kid, I started playing games on Roblox, one of the most popular gaming
                platforms out there. Eventually, I figured out I could make my own games too. Even though I didn't know
                much
                about coding at age 12, I started putting together a game using ready-made stuff. I called it "Eyes -
                the
                Horror Game (Roblox)" and got the idea from one of my favorite games at the time. It was about exploring
                a
                spooky mansion while dodging a creepy monster. When I finished it, I excitedly shared it, hoping people
                would play. But sadly, it didn't catch on right away.</p>

            <p class="mainText">I didn't give up, though. I kept adding more features and improving the game. Then came
                2020, a tough year for everyone because of COVID-19. Schools were closed, and life was hard. For me,
                though,
                it was a turning point. At just 13, I threw myself into improving my game, and finally, people started
                noticing it. I remember that moment vividly—it was the first time my work got recognized. I started
                getting
                feedback, both good and bad, which really helped me grow as a developer.</p>

            <p class="mainText">One piece of negative feedback stuck with me: they said the game wasn't great because I
                used
                free pre-made models. So, I decided to redo the whole map from scratch and learn proper coding. That
                made a
                big difference—people started liking the game even more.</p>

            <p class="mainText">As more players joined, I even started earning money from Roblox. It wasn't a lot, but
                it
                was enough to keep me going and take the game seriously. Today, it's still active. You can check it out
                <a href="https://www.roblox.com/games/1985320156" style="color: #007baf;">here</a> or visit <a

                it.

            <summary class="subTitle">My current projects</summary>
            <p class="mainText">As of today, I've completed many projects, with more to finish and start.</p>

            <p class="mainText">My priority is to launch a new business called Kadri24 Digits. Since childhood, I've
                dreamed
                of creating games with a larger team to deliver higher quality. Unfortunately, I currently lack the
                resources to make that dream a reality, so for now, I remain an independent hobbyist creating games.</p>

            <p class="mainText">Some of my games currently available on the Roblox platform include:</p>
            <ul class="mainText" style="padding-left: 22%;">
                <li>Eyes: Scary Thriller - Horror (Roblox)</li>
                <li>Slendrina: The Cellar (Roblox)</li>
                <li>Infinite Obby</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="mainText">My ongoing projects are:</p>
            <ul class="mainText" style="padding-left: 22%;">
                <li>Slender the Eight Pages (Roblox)</li>
                <li>PT (Roblox)</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="mainText">While I work on finishing those games, I'm also learning new programming languages like
                Python and creating new websites using my knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>

            <p class="mainText">Additionally, I've begun using other game engines such as Unity to create games outside
                of
                Roblox. I find Roblox limiting in its tools and believe it underpays its developers.</p>

            <p class="mainText">Recently, I created and launched my first bot on the popular social platform Discord
                using
                Python. It includes basic commands for my Discord server.</p>

            <p class="mainText">On the hardware side, I've been learning how computer components work by watching online
                videos and learning from technicians. I have a passion for working with computer parts.</p>

            <summary class="subTitle">Future projects</summary>
            <p class="mainText">I have a lot of things I would want to do in the future and I'm sure I'll never stop
                thinking of a new thing after I've finish with the current one.</p>
            <p class="mainText">I would love starting to invest, I think it's risky but can be worth it if studied well.
                This can make my income even higher for my future company and having more money to innovate it.</p>
            <p class="mainText">Other than keep going with what I'm working on, such as games, learning new programming
                languages and learning new things technology-wise, I would like to start creating some contents, paid
                and
                not to help people and inspire them.</p>
