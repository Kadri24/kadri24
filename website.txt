Kadri Gjini – kadri24 Portfolio
👋 About Me
Hi, I’m Kadri Gjini, also known online as kadri24. I was born on June 24, 2006, in Italy, and I’ve always been someone who explores new challenges. Whether it was playing football professionally, learning guitar, or simply trying new things, I was always curious — but one passion stood out and never left: coding.
At just 8 years old, I began experimenting with Roblox Studio. I didn’t know much about scripting at the time, but I dove in anyway. One of my first games, a version of Eyes the Horror Game, gained attention and gave me the motivation to continue. From that point on, coding became more than just a hobby — it became part of who I am.
Since then, I’ve created multiple games, including Slendrina: The Cellar, Slender: The Eight Pages, and Eyes: Scary Thriller — all within Roblox. I’ve also expanded beyond Roblox, learning and using languages like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, Java, C++, and C# to create websites, tools, and future projects.
My ultimate goal is to build a creative game and software development studio called Kadri24 Digits — where I’ll continue making high-quality, immersive, and fun experiences for players and users around the world.
